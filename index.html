        <h1>Recipie: German schnitzel</h1>
        <br>
        <h4>History of schnitzel: It stated when people from Israel started making schnitzel out of veal, as time went on veal became harder to obtain so the people started using turkey or chicken becuase it was more abundant. Then many Jewish poeple moved to Europe and brought schnitzel with them. They made their way to Germany in Germany they called beef schnizel Weiner schnizel and schnizel without beef schnizel nach weiner. They made their "own" type of schnizel, it was schnizel with pork.</h4>
